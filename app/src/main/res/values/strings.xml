    <string name="dev_text">Hello everyone! This is a study project where I created a Pokédex for Android, using all the tools from Android Jetpack! Android Jetpack is a set of libraries and tools by Google that make Android app development easier. In this project, I use the Clean + MVVM architecture. With the Pokédex, I explored advanced features of Android such as the Navigation Component, Flow, Room, Data Binding, ViewModel, WorkManager, Paging Library, and Hilt for dependency injection. The goal is to create a functional Pokédex and share the complete example, demonstrating how to use these Android Jetpack tools with the Clean + MVVM architecture.</string>
